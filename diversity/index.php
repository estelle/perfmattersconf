<p>We realize that buying a ticket to a conference for many isn't a trivial expense, but it can be a turning point in someone's career.</p>

<p>We're committed to bringing in as many individuals who couldn't attend otherwise as possible. We want you to feel like you belong and build a lasting, inclusive, safe community. As organizers, we see it as our responsibility to help diversify the face of the web performance industry. We strongly encourage members of underrepresented groups to apply.<p>

<p>Please note that the scholarships cover conference registration only, so you will have to arrange travel and any accommodation, if necessary. We do have a #HOUSING channel in Slack where you can try to find someone to share a hotel room with, or even ask someone to share their corporate sponsored hotel room at hopefully reduced to no cost. </p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>Applicants for a free or reduced ticket diversity ticket have to fulfill at least one of the below requirements:</p>

<ul><li>be a member of an underrepresented group in tech, including, but not limited to women, LGBTQI+, African-American, Native American, Latinx, people with disabilities and people facing economic or social hardships</li>
<li>be unable to attend without financial assistance</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to apply</h3>
<p>Fill out this form:</p>

<p>You'll be notified of the result no matter the outcome. Application review and notification is on a rolling basis, and closes March 21, 2019. All information will be kept confidential except the review committee.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://cssconf.au">CSSConf.au</a> for their diversity program, which I took as the base for writing this</p>
