<li>When it makes sense to focus on perceived performance over outright speed

			$talk_description = 'Websites may be slow, but the web itself moves fast. Every day new techniques and tools emerge, promising to make your site faster and lighter. New articles are written about the latest "best practices" in performance, only to have yet newer articles contradict them. When the technologies and techniques we use to make websites more performant change so quickly, it&rsquo;s easy to feel like you&rsquo;re falling behind.<br/><br/>

But if you pull back the layers and the hype, drilling into the core concepts of how the network and browsers we rely on actually work, it suddenly becomes much easier to recognize which best practices are actually appropriate for you, and what trade-offs you&rsquo;re making.
<br/><br/>
In this workshop, we&rsquo;ll go beyond the latest and greatest techniques and tools to understand what is going on at the core. We&rsquo;ll explore:<br/><br/>

&middot; How the browser renders pages, from the very first request on the network to the final pixel on your screen<br/>
&middot; What the critical rendering path is and how to optimize for it<br/>
&middot; How HTTP/2 differs from HTTP/1 and what that means for popular opimizations<br/>
&middot; How to identify common performance bottlenecks in your sites and applications<br/>
<br/>By the time we&rsquo;re done, you&rsquo;ll have a firm understanding of what makes sites fast, and how to separate the hype from reality.';
