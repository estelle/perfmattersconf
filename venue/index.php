<h2>Room Share</h2>
		<p>Looking to save money by sharing a room? Looking to help someone out who doesn't have the budget for a bay area hotel room? Please <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/perfmattersconf/shared_invite/enQtMjkyMDM3MTAxMzQ3LTBjNmQyOTFiNzEzMjFmZjA5ODZiODhiZDZjMWFmYjJkY2VlZjlmNWYyOWU4ZjA4ZDViZjVjZmIyNGJhYzNmYzM">join the #PerfMatters Slack channel</a> and find a roommate. </p><p>If you do have a hotel room, consider offering up the second bed in your hotel room to someone who doesn't have corporate sponsorship.</p> 
<h2>Note about Pacific Euro Hotel</h2>
<p>The Pacific Euro Hotel is a 1-star Hotel at 868 Main St, Redwood City, CA: If you want to stay at the most inexpensive place around, this is it. It's a dumpy hotel with parking that is metered from 10:00am to 6:00pm. I think it has shared bathrooms and the internet is not secure, but the location and price are great. The hotel is located downtown, near all the restaurants and coffee shops. There are a few homeless people on that block, but it's a safe city.  We can not recommend this place at all. However, if you don't have corporate sponsorship for your hotel stay, it is the only place on the Peninsula that is under $100. I think it's about $69/night with shared bathroom, $89/night with your own bathroom. </p>

	<h2>Getting here</h2>
	<p>Cañada College is a community college located half way between San Francisco and Silicon Valley.  The campus is at 4200 Farm Hill Boulevard in an unincorporated area of San Mateo County, California, just off Highway 280.</p>

	<h3>By Plane: SFO, SJC, and OAK are all A.O.K.</h3>
	<p>While SFO / San Francisco will have the best direct options, realize the conference is half way between SFO /San Francisco and SJC / Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport.</p>
	<p> A little less convenient, but still completely doable, and just and extra 8 miles further, is OAK / Oakland International Airport, in Oakland, CA.

<h2>Accessibility and Inclusion</h2>
<h3>We aim to have a welcoming and inclusive event</h3>
<p>In order to have an inclusive event with a welcoming atmosphere, we hope to remove all accessibility barriers that may hinder anyone from attending this event. If there are any issues that you feel may prevent you from attending and fully enjoying this event, we will do our best to accommodate, but we need to know ahead of time as best we can what those issues may be. <a href="mailto:support@perfmattersconf.com?subject=conference&20accessibility">Please get in touch</a> and let us know what we can do to help.</p>
<ul><li>The conference is mostly one track in an ADA compliant yet not fully accessible theatre. There is a ramp to get to the theatre, and a lift to get up the five steps from the entrance to the theatre foyer. Stepless access within the main theater includes the last row, the first two rows, and the stage.</li>
<li>The second track half track, if there is one, is in the same building, and is fully accessible with no steps</li>
<li>The dining / drinks / party / expo area is in "The Grove", located about 80 meters from the theatre, with about 25 steps. There is elevator access. The 80 meters are outside. We tend to have amazing weather in California, but there is a small chance of rain, but no chance of freezing or boiling temperatures</li>
<li>There is accessible parking directly between the theatre and The Grove. There is also accessible parking directly behind both venues. If you have an accessibility parking placard and are able to walk a flight of stairs, please use the parking behind the venue, leaving the five spots between the venue for those unable to otherwise access the venue.</li>
<li>If you need assistance, such as a Sign language interpreter, a complimentary ticket will be provided. They do need to register though, so let us know. If you aren't local, please contact us. We'll find an interpreter for the event.</li>
<li>There will be a diversity program to bring more people from typically under represented people in tech into the web performance family.</li>
<li>There are meat and vegetarian options. Please let us know when you register if you are vegan, celiac, or have other dietary requirements needing our attention.</li>
<li>There will be a slack for the event, including a slack channel dedicating to "housing". If you are willing to share your company (or personally) paid hotel room with someone who can't afford it, or live near the venue and willing to host an out of town guest, we encourage you to post your availability in that chat room so people who need assistance can privately DM you to take you up on your generosity.</li>
</ul><p>In case you haven't figured it out, we want to ensure anyone who wants to attend this event can attend this event.<sup>*</sup></p></div></div></div></section>
