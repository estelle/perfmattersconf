	<h3>By Public Transportation: Bus #274 from RWC CalTrain</h3>
	<p>If you're coming by public transportation, you'll want to catch the bus from the Redwood City CalTrain station. 
	<p>Catch bus #274 from the Redwood City Transit station, just opposite the Redwood City CalTrain station. The bus leaves every half hour at 14m and 43m past the hour. <p>If you see a bunch of people waiting, ask if they're heading to Canada College and share a Lyft (not an Uber).
	<h3>By Plane: SFO, SJC, and OAK are all A.O.K.</h3>
	<p>While SFO / San Francisco will have the best direct options, realize the conference is half way between SFO /San Francisco and SJC / Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport.</p>
	<p> A little less convenient, but still completely doable, and just and extra 8 miles further, is OAK / Oakland International Airport, in Oakland, CA.
