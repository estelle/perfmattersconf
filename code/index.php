<h2>The Quick Version</h2>

<p>#PerfMatters Conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), employer, employment status, or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
<p>Additionally, we expect participants to be proactively nice and respectful of everyone, from the other participants, to the speakers, to the organizers, to the caterers, to the cleaning crew: EVERYONE.</p>

<h2>The Less&ndash;Quick Version</h2>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior, or any demeaning or otherwise unwelcome behavior, are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.  In addition, booth schwag should not be gendered. For examples, there is no such thing as a unisex t-shirt. Either have both loose and fit shirts, or offer different schwag.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by a clearly marked "STAFF" shirt.</p>

<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>

<p>Be nice to everyone, and treat everyone with equal respect. Speak as politely to the other participants, the speakers, the organizers, the caterers, and the cleaning crew as you would to your boss.</p>

<p>Include everyone. In conversations, be inclusive and welcoming. Do not "backpack". Backpacking is when you exclude a person from a group conversation by turning your back to them. It's called back packing because often times people do this actually smack people with their back packs. Instead, open up the circle and welcome other participants into your conversation, regardless of age difference, gender difference, racial difference, or any other differences you may have.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.</p>
